# Guitar Technique Classification

**A work-in-progress project to explore Music Information Retrieval (MIR) by automatically identifying guitar playing techniques (e.g., bending, vibrato, slides) from audio signals.**

## Project Description

This is my first computational music project. As a guitar player and maker with over 20 years of experience, I am leveraging my domain knowledge to explore how machine learning can be used to understand and categorize nuances in musical performance.

The goal is to build a tool that can serve as a practice aid for guitar students or an analytical tool for musicologists.

## Current Status & Learning Goals

- **Learning the fundamentals:** I am currently taking courses on Python, Machine Learning, and Digital Signal Processing.
- **Toolchain setup:** Getting familiar with LibROSA for audio feature extraction and Scikit-learn for building models.
- **Data collection:** Exploring datasets (e.g., [IDMT-SMT-Guitar](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/business_units/m2d/smt/guitar.html)) and planning to record my own samples.

## Next Steps

1. Extract MFCC, spectral contrast, and chroma features from sample audio.
2. Implement a baseline classifier (e.g., SVM) to test feasibility.
3. Experiment with different neural network architectures.

## About Me
